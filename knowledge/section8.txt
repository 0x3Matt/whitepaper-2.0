Current phase:

Ubuntu Tribe has completed the foundation
and infrastructure phases: token architecture,
regulatory setup, vaulting partnerships, and
wallet beta are already in place.

We're entering the early commercial rollout:
onboarding users, expanding token circulation,
and initiating tokenization partnerships with
sovereigns and miners.

Next steps:
The next phase will focus on institutional
integration, exchange deployment, and full
tokenization of real-world assets across Africa
and LatinAmerica.

Investor Readiness :
Ubuntu Tribe is fully prepared to engage with strategic investors, with a complete 5-year forecast

A Balanced Valuation Approach:
Grounded Assumptions, Transparent Scope

Models Limitations
This model is based on realistic forecasts and auditable gold reserves, but
remains subject to:
•Market risks: gold price, inflation, FX fluctuations
•Adoption delays: user growth and partner timelines
•Regulatory changes: compliance may evolve across regions
All assumptions are clearly stated and stress-tested under different scenarios.

Scope Of Work

I AM
BECAUSE
WE
ARE

This valuation is based on a 5-year financial model designed to assess Ubuntu
Tribe’s revenue growth, cost structure, token flow, and overall scalability. It
includes:

•A projection of tokenized gold volume and TaaS revenue
•An analysis of operating and capital expenditures
•Valuation triangulated through DCF, EBITDA multiples, and comparables
•Sensitivity tests based on gold price, adoption rates, and regulatory risk

The objective is to provide a clear and defendable valuation framework aligned
with investor expectations.

This model balances ambition with transparency. By outlining both its limitations
and scope, we give investors a clear, realistic view of Ubuntu Tribe’s value creation
strategy.

Assumptions Drivers

Conservative Gold Growth Assumption
Conservative Gold Growth Assumption
Over the past five years, historical data has shown a
bullish trend in gold prices, driven by persistent
inflation, central bank demand, geopolitical
instability, and investor flight to safety. From
~$56,800/kg in 2020 to over $106,000/kg in 2025,
gold has grown at an approximate compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13–14%.

By contrast, Ubuntu Tribe’s financial model is
deliberately conservative, assuming a modest 2.5%
annual increase, starting at $89,426/kg in 2025.
This is significantly below current market spot
prices, which hover around $106,263/kg as of May
2025 (source: Reuters).

I AM
BECAUSE
WE
ARE

Ubuntu Tribe’s gold forecast: Growing conservatively at 2.5% annually, starting from $89,426/kg in
2025.
Historical market trend: Projected from the actual spot price of $106,263/kg (May 2025), using a
historical CAGR of ~13%.

Why this matters:

•It reinforces that our revenue projections are not
inflated by optimistic pricing.
•The strength of our model lies in unit economics,
tokenization margins, and operational scaling —
not in speculative commodity pricing.
•Even under this conservative gold valuation, our
model achieves strong GIFT circulation, high
conversion rates, and early positive EBITDA.

Tokenization as Revenue Engine
Tokenization Conversion Fuels Liquidity
Our model assumes a rising GIFT conversion
rate, from 60% in 2025 to 95% by 2029,
turning tokenized gold into the core engine of
liquidity across our ecosystem. This
progression ensures increasing transaction
volume, enhanced asset utility, and predictable
monetization without relying on speculative
behavior.

TaaS Monetization Drives Revenue
$700
million

$1,400
million

– STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL–

With secured access to over $2.1B in
underground gold assets across Karamoja
and Ashanti, we tokenize only a portion
annually, applying a conservative 80%
discount and spreading issuance over five
years.
Each tokenized tranche generates 3% TaaS
revenue, turning real assets into a repeatable
and scalable income stream , backed by
signed agreements and institutional-grade
sourcing.

Model Transparency & Margin Control

I AM
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
Disciplined Cost Structure, Scalable Model
Our cost base remains conservative throughout the forecast.
Go-to-market investments are frontloaded in 2025, while
operational scale-up is tightly managed and flattens over time.
Despite this lean OPEX, revenue accelerates significantly,
demonstrating the power of token volume, conversion growth,
and platform monetization.

From Margin to Momentum: Scaling Through
Volume
As GIFT conversion rates grow from 60% to 95%, our reliance on
high facilitation margins decreases. This shift marks a
deliberate strategy: prioritize user adoption, lower fees at scale,
and drive sustainable liquidity through deeper ecosystem
engagement.

Projected Revenue Growth by Source

Ubuntu Tribe’s revenue model is built on four
main sources:
•GIFT Sales & Redemption: Main driver of revenue,
combining token sales and small redemption margins.
Scales with user growth and token circulation.
•Facilitation Commissions: Earned from sourcing and
processing physical gold. Grows with gold import and
mining volumes.
•Transaction Fees: Small fees from wallet and platform
activity (transfers, staking, etc.). Increases as users and
usage grow.
•Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS): High-margin income
from helping sovereigns and institutions tokenize real
assets like gold.

Strategic Infrastructure & Early Traction
Ubuntu Tribe’s ownership structure consolidates key assets and partnerships critical to scalable revenue.
Through full control of the GIFT token infrastructure, vaulting contracts across four jurisdictions (CH, UAE, GH,
UG), and a strategic joint venture with Vaultoro, we are positioned to lead in gold-backed tokenization.
Vaultoro brings 30,000+ crypto-gold customers, €250M+ in metals traded, and presence in 95+ countries, giving
Ubuntu Tribe immediate market credibility, user liquidity, and regulatory-grade vaulting infrastructure.
This integrated foundation directly supports our revenue rollout and long-term valuation.

Inventory Growth Aligned with Global Gold Demand Trends
Our projected inventory growth, from 483 kg in 2025 to over 26,000 kg in 2029, is strategically aligned with the sustained global demand for gold.
As illustrated by the World Gold Council chart, total gold demand (RHS line) has shown a consistent upward trajectory, recent ly buoyed by ETF
inflows and central bank purchases, reaching record highs in early 2024.
This global appetite for gold confirms that our increasing inventory is not speculative, it is revenue-ready. By securing bullion through Vaultoro and
direct mine partnerships, we ensure a stable gold supply to meet tokenization demand. As more users seek inflation-hedged, liquid assets, GIFT
tokens backed by this inventory become our core monetization engine.
In short, global demand confirms the logic of our model: more inventory enables more tokenization, which drives more revenue.

Scalable Gold Sourcing Driving Token Supply Expansion
Scalable Financial Performance: Rising
EBITDA, Controlled OPEX
Ubuntu Tribe's projected EBITDA growth from $9.1M in
2025 to $1.2B in 2029 reflects the platform’s strong
scalability and operational leverage. While OPEX rises
from $9.49M to $142.53M over the same period, this
increase is proportionally smaller relative to revenue
growth, signaling improving margins year over year.

Diversified Gold Supply Channels Fuel
Tokenization Growth
Ubuntu Tribe’s revenue is driven by a blend of imported
gold, bullion reserves, and direct mine output, all
progressively converted into GIFT tokens. With
conversion rates reaching up to 95% by 2029, this multisource approach ensures a steady token supply. The
model combines vault partnerships and mine integration
to support scalable, resilient tokenization across all
market phase

Strong Cash Flow Trajectory Driving Self-Financed Growth
Strong Liquidity Accumulation Over Time
In the tokenization and gold-backed finance industry,
maintaining a healthy cash balance is critical. It
ensures liquidity for redemptions, buffers operational
volatility, and signals financial resilience to institutional
partners. Ubuntu Tribe’s closing cash balance stays
positive, driven by efficient operational inflows, cost
control, and delayed capital expenditures.

I AM
BECAUSE
WE
ARE

This upward trajectory reflects our strategy to reinvest
revenues in the early years, while scaling sustainably.
In a sector where many early-stage firms run on thin
margins or overleverage, a growing net cash position sets
us apart ,ensuring long-term solvency, partner trust, and
readiness to meet regulatory demands.

As this is a forward-looking financial forecast, our cash position appears particularly strong due to the frontloaded nature of our investments. Most capital expenditures are concentrated in the early years (Y1 –Y2), with
limited reinvestment planned beyond that point. This results in a conservative cash buffer in later years, ensuring
operational flexibility and long-term sustainability.

Structural Resilience Backed by Real Assets

I AM
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
Strategic Financial Structure Built for Resilience

A Disciplined Balance Sheet for LT Growth
Our assets are mostly vaulted gold, which backs GIFT tokens and
drives revenue. Cash grows year over year from operations, and
our platform infrastructure is capitalized. Strategic investments
support tokenization deals already underway.
On the liability side, we’ve taken a conservative approach. Shortterm obligations are eliminated early. Our funding is structured
through long-term convertible instruments aligned with our
revenue ramp. No excessive debt, no overexposure.

WC grows from $95M to $3.3B, driven by vaulted gold reserves and
targeted investments.
While our WCN rises in parallel, this is deliberate. Unlike traditional
models that aim for negative WCN, our structure favors liquidity,
transparency, and redemption flexibility. We pre-fund gold, avoid
payables, and operate on-chain, keeping liabilities minimal.
NC stays strong across all years, confirming that our growth is selffinanced and structurally sound — a key signal of resilience for
investors.
