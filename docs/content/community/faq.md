## Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to our comprehensive FAQ section. We've organized the most common questions about Ubuntu Tribe, GIFT tokens, and gold tokenization to help you understand our revolutionary approach to Real-World Asset (RWA) investment.

### Getting Started

#### **What is Ubuntu Tribe?**
Ubuntu Tribe is the world's first regenerative gold economy platform. We tokenize physical gold through GIFT tokens (1 token = 1 gram of LBMA-certified gold) while creating sustainable partnerships with artisanal mining communities. Our platform combines the stability of gold with blockchain technology and AI-powered yield generation.

#### **What does "Ubuntu" mean?**
Ubuntu is an African philosophy meaning "I am because we are." It recognizes that individual prosperity is inseparable from collective well-being. This philosophy guides everything we do - from fair trade mining partnerships to community governance and environmental restoration.

#### **How is Ubuntu Tribe different from other gold tokens?**
Unlike simple gold-backed tokens, Ubuntu Tribe creates a regenerative economy:
- **Community partnerships** with artisanal miners (15-20% above market rates)
- **Environmental restoration** programs (mercury-free mining, reforestation)
- **AI-powered yield generation** (8-15% APY through diversified strategies)
- **Democratic governance** through Ubuntu DAO
- **Social impact** - supporting 1.4B unbanked people globally

#### **Is Ubuntu Tribe safe and legitimate?**
Yes. We maintain the highest security and transparency standards:
- **LBMA-certified gold** backing with real-time verification
- **Third-party audits** of all gold reserves and platform finances
- **Multi-signature security** for all critical operations
- **Regulatory compliance** across all operating jurisdictions
- **Open-source code** for community verification

### GIFT Tokens

#### **What are GIFT tokens?**
GIFT (Gold International Fungible Token) tokens are digital certificates representing physical gold. Each GIFT token is backed by exactly 1 gram of LBMA-certified gold stored in secure vaults. You can trade, stake, or redeem GIFT tokens for physical gold at any time.

#### **How do I verify my tokens are backed by real gold?**
We provide complete transparency:
- **Real-time dashboard** showing exact gold reserves and token supply

- **Blockchain verification** of all gold purchases and storage
- **Vault webcams** and regular video updates

#### **Can I exchange GIFT tokens for physical gold?**
Yes! You can redeem GIFT tokens for physical gold:
- **Minimum redemption**: 100 GIFT tokens (100 grams of gold)
- **Delivery options**: Secure vault pickup or insured shipping
- **Processing time**: 5-7 business days
- **Fees**: Minimal processing and shipping costs

### Staking and Yields

#### **How does GIFT token staking work?**
Staking allows you to earn additional returns while supporting the ecosystem:
- **Staking rewards**: 8-15% APY from multiple revenue streams
- **Minimum stake**: 10 GIFT tokens
- **Lock periods**: 30, 90, or 365 days (higher APY for longer locks)
- **Compound earnings**: Automatic reinvestment of rewards
- **Early withdrawal**: Available with penalty (varies by lock period)

#### **What generates the staking rewards?**
Staking rewards come from diversified revenue streams:
- **Gold appreciation**: Historical 7-10% annual returns
- **Mining profits**: Direct participation in community mining revenues
- **AI trading**: Algorithmic optimization of precious metals positions
