INTRODUCING THE ERA OF "OPPORTUNITY ECONOMY"
With the belief "I am because we are," we strive to build a
secure, innovative, and inclusive financial system for
everyone.
We're pioneers in tokenizing real-world assets into digital
opportunities, starting with gold, through our digital gold
certificate, GIFT, which is backed 1:1 by physical gold.

We believe in a world where individuals and
communities can have universal access to
opportunities enabled by financial freedom
and interconnected humanity.

Ubuntu Tribe represents the future of connected finance.
Using AI and blockchain, we make it easy for anyone to
create and preserve wealth from their mobile device.

Ubuntu Tribe stands for empowered humanity, ethical
growth, and shared prosperity.

Our Thesis : Transcend Financial Inclusion into Financial Mobility
Over the next decade, fintech must shift from inclusion to mobility, as 1.4 billion unbanked mostly lower middle class and
bottom of the pyramid face persistent debt and poverty cycles.

AI-Powered Literacy
“We make gold accessible to everyone
through mobile and blockchain.”
Overcome Barriers

Tokenize Real-World
Assets (RWA)

Web3 eliminates collateral
constraints by fractionalizing
assets, addressing information
asymmetry with transparent
ledger data, and unlocking
leveraged wealth for 2.5 billion
underserved people.

AI to provide tailored financial
literacy tutorials, real-time
investment recommendations, and
predictive risk models, analyzing
user data to achieve up to 15%
annual staking returns by Q3 2025.

Web3 turns physical assets into
blockchain-based tokens, enabling
fractional ownership (e.g., a
$100,000 gold bar split into $1
tokens). This increases accessibility,
liquidity, and transparency, while
smart contracts reduce
intermediary costs by up to 30%.

THE PROBLEM – A BROKEN SYSTEM
Global Poverty &
Financial Exclusion
Financial
exclusion
restricts
access to economic opportunities,
perpetuating
poverty
across
regions.

•

•

Approximately
1.4
billion
people, with over half in seven
countries, rely on informal
borrowing due to limited
formal financial services.
700 million live on less than
$2.15 daily, with one-third in
Africa,
where
Sub-Saharan
Africa accounts for half of
global
multidimensional
poverty.

Mining & Environmental
Harm
Artisanal and small-scale mining
contributes significantly to
environmental degradation while
deepening poverty and exclusion,
particularly in regions with limited
regulation and access to sustainable
alternatives.
•

•

Artisanal gold mining (ASGM)
emits 2,000 tons of mercury
annually, the top source of global
mercury pollution, damaging
health and ecosystems.

10-15 million people, including 4-5
million women and children, are
involved in ASGM, exacerbating
environmental and social harm.

Lack of Financial
Literacy

…..

Widespread
financial
illiteracy
hinders
understanding
of
investments
and
risk
management, trapping individuals
in poverty cycles.

•

This knowledge gap limits
economic
empowerment,
especially for the lower middle
class and bottom of the
pyramid, amid global economic
crises like high inflation and
currency depreciation.

Economic Mobility: Fintech’s progress hasn’t delivered scalable paths to asset ownership or long-term prosperity,
keeping the lower middle class and bottom of the pyramid stuck in poverty and debt.
Financial Literacy Deficit: While fintech has expanded access to finance, a lack of investment and risk knowledge
prevents millions from building wealth, perpetuating debt cycles.
