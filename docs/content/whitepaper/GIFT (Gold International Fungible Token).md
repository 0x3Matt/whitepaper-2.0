# What is GIFT and how it works

## Overview

GIFT stands for Gold Internation Fungible Token.

Gold tokenization is a big change to the gold markets as the development of ETFs but with the added advantage of appealing to younger generations.

Throughout the history of humanity, gold has been serving as an exceptional store of value. Not only is it highly durable and impervious to destruction or synthesis but it also provides investors with a means to combat inflation. However, certain drawbacks have dissuaded many from holding the asset. The challenges of transferring and dividing gold into smaller units make investing in the precious metal with true ownership a complex endeavor.

Gold-backed cryptocurrencies provide an innovative solution to the above problems by tokenizing the precious metal to offer fractional ownership over real-world bullions that buyers and sellers can seamlessly exchange on digital asset trading platforms.

The Utribe.one Platform and its ecosystem will be powered by multiple digital assets.

Prometheus Tranding hereby the holding and its subsidiaries (hereby called Utribe) is the token issuance and custody company.
