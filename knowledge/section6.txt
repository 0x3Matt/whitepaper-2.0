Ubuntu Tribe DAO
UTribe DAO is a decentralized governance system that rewards ecosystem contributors with TRIBE tokens and empowers
them to vote, stake, and shape key decisions.

UTribe Governance System
UTribe is building a compliant, community-led governance system evolving into a DAO, powered by the TRIBE token for
decentralized, professional decision-making.
Not a security token: TRIBE holders are not shareholders
but ecosystem participants.

Validator-Based Delegated
Governance

Voting

Participate in governance by voting on proposals and
electing validators.

Staking

Stake TRIBE tokens in validator pools to secure the
network.

Rewards

Earn rewards from transaction fees (GIFTbased)

UTribe employs a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system to
ensure decentralized decision-making with transparent and
rotating leadership.

•

Validator Elections: Token holders elect validators based
on trust and performance.

Transparent Operations:
• Validators must publicly share their positions on proposals.
• All proposals and validator statements are published for
transparency.

Econoic Participatation

Flexible Voting:
• Token holders delegate voting power to validators.
• Voting power can be split or reallocated at any time.

• Gold Suppliers: Earn TRIBE for providing certified gold.
• Partners: Earn TRIBE for bringing active users to the
ecosystem.

UTribe's governance prevents centralized control, fostering
trust-based staking with transparent, community-driven
accountability.

• Users: Receive TRIBE as referral rewards.

Impact: Links real economic participation to governance
influence without equity dilution or legal ambiguity.

DAO Implementation and Ecosystem Structure
From contribution to control: building a decentralized, regulated DAO.

The DAO Structure
Ubuntu Global Holdings

The UTribe Foundation

The Board

Leads initial bootstrapping
(55% of supply), develops
tech, coordinates partners.

Drives ecosystem growth,
manages social impact, and
submits DAO proposals.

Professionals from legal, tech,
gold, and bizdev centers of
excellence, elected by DAO
vote.

Community Users
Refer new users, earn and
stake TRIBE, and shape the
governance.

Legal foundation:
•
DAO registered in Wyoming, with further jurisdictions considered (Liechtenstein, Bahamas, UAE)
•
Gold is held in certified vaults; upon tokenization, ownership transfers to the DAO
•
Redemption is possible in 10g, 100g, or 1kg bars with full compliance and reporting.

This structure ensures a smooth transition from centralized bootstrap to fully decentralized
governance.
