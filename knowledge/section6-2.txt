INTRODUCING THE ERA OF "OPPORTUNITY ECONOMY"
With the belief "I am because we are," we strive to build a
secure, innovative, and inclusive financial system for
everyone.
We're pioneers in tokenizing real-world assets into digital
opportunities, starting with gold, through our digital gold
certificate, GIFT, which is backed 1:1 by physical gold.

We believe in a world where individuals and
communities can have universal access to
opportunities enabled by financial freedom
and interconnected humanity.

Ubuntu Tribe represents the future of connected finance.
Using AI and blockchain, we make it easy for anyone to
create and preserve wealth from their mobile device.

Ubuntu Tribe stands for empowered humanity, ethical
growth, and shared prosperity.

Advantages of illiquid tokenization
Maximizes liquidity without needing to

Increases market value of assets,
gives data transparency, reduces risk,
and encourages good stewardship

Low capital cost creates financing options that
maintains ownership stake and allows for

On-site Mining Management
We are building a local team to implement and manage gold supply chain ope rations, fr om onboarding miners and collecting
gold to operating mobile units and ensuring secure transport for refining in Dubai after EMR pr ocess.

Phase 1 PoC

• Team Building, education
• Exploring current local conditions and
workflows
• Optimizing workflows
• Proof new operational workflows
• Collection of all needed information’s for
ethical sourcing
• Collection of sourced Gold
• Secure export and refining in Dubai
• Manage refining, transports, insurance,
vaulting

Phase 2 TBD (From T3 2025)

• Scale the model to other locations
• Improve processes
• Automate miner payments, employment

Results / Goals
The team also oversees community engagement, work conditions, and
sustainability surveys.
All data is integrated into our Track & Trace platform to ensure verified
origin and ethical sourcing (sustainable goals of WHO / OECD).

Mining Technology - Gold Extraction
EMR technology boosts gold extraction efficiency by up to 80%, depending on existing methods. Mobile units will be deployed
on-site (one per location). Gold is then transported to Dubai for refining to 99.999 global standards, with video documentation of
the melting process serving as origin proof.

Phase 1 PoC

• Construct on-site units (EMR technology)
• Setup logistics for secure transport to
Dubai-based refineries
• Staff and security around gold
collection/refining
• Define locations to clean the gold out of
extracted ground
• Circulation phases
• Measure results and store proofs to
blockchain

THE UBUNTU TRIBE ECONOMY

Phase 2 TBD

• Build 5 – 10 improved units
• Expand Territories

Dubai’s refinery can process up to 15 kg of gold per
day post-EMR. The mercury-free EMR technology’s
output depends on ore quality, and multiple units
can increase the volume of material available for
refining.

Miner / User Onboarding Flow
Suppliers here called miners or local collection stations register via our public endpoint (APP). Following steps
are mandatory and flexible in adjustment according to data that must be collected (jurisdictions, type of participant).

Phase 1 PoC

Phase 2 TBD

• Create Login
• Provide personal data (address, country,
birthday)
• Setup 2-Factor authentication
• User KYC (Passport/ID/Driver License
and a Selfie with liveness detection)
• KYB (Know your Business if it is a
corporate Company)
• Agreement setup (conditions) and
contracts
• Ready Gold supply can be registered
into the track and trace system

•
•

Redirect Miners to Utribe Wallet app, settings for
automated payment
Payments can be made in Fiat or GOLD Token

Results / Goals
The Proof of Concept successfully validated a functional
system with strong performance, ready to scale and
integrate GODL for ecosystem-wide payments and
partner onboarding.

What We’ve Learned, and Where We’re Going
The PoC provided valuable insights to guide the pilot and scale-up phases.

Develop data quality framework for B2C
application.
Develop implementation guide for onboarding
and 1st level customer support.

Develop a standardized web service interface
(3rd party API) for access to partners for Phase 2.

Provide detailed guidelines about data formats
and mandatory/optional data elements and
integration points.
Proof compliance and legal frameworks

Roadmap
The 6-month pilot follows four defined milestones, with a multi-country rollout plan in place. PoC learnings will
guide the pilot, as we prepare the company for growth and scaling.
