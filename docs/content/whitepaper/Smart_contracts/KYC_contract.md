## KYC Contract Documentation

### KYC Contract Overview

The Ubuntu KYC contract allows for the creation, modification, and assignment of KYC levels to user addresses, with each level including a name and an associated swap limit.

### Key Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControlUpgradeable to manage permissions through roles:
   - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: Can add, modify, and remove KYC levels
   - KYC_ACCOUNTANT_ROLE: Can assign KYC levels to user addresses

2. **KYC Level Management**:
   - Create new KYC levels with custom names and swap limits
   - Modify existing KYC levels
   - Remove KYC levels when no longer needed

3. **User KYC Level Assignment**:
   - Assign KYC levels to specific user addresses
   - Retrieve KYC level information for any user

4. **Upgradability**:
   - Built using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts pattern
   - Can be upgraded to add functionality while preserving state

### Integration for External Partners

External partners can integrate with this KYC contract in the following ways:

#### Viewing KYC Information

```solidity
// Get a user's KYC level ID
function getKYCLevel(address _account) external view returns (uint256)

// Get complete list of available KYC levels
function getKYCLevels() external view returns (KYCLevel[] memory)
```

#### Integration Examples

1. **For Gift Services**:
   - Check if a user has the required KYC level before processing gift transactions
   - Example: `uint256 userKYCLevel = kycContract.getKYCLevel(userAddress);`

2. **For Swap Applications**:
   - Verify user's swap limit based on their KYC level before executing swaps
   - Example:
   ```solidity
   uint256 levelId = kycContract.getKYCLevel(userAddress);
   KYCLevel[] memory levels = kycContract.getKYCLevels();
   uint256 swapLimit = levels[levelId].swapLimit;
   require(swapAmount <= swapLimit, "Swap exceeds KYC limit");
   ```

3. **For Purchase Verification**:
   - Implement purchase limits based on KYC level
   - Restrict certain products/services to specific KYC levels

### Security Considerations

1. All level modifications and role assignments should be performed only by authorized addresses
2. External contracts integrating with this KYC contract should validate return values
3. Consider implementing circuit breakers or emergency stops for critical functionality

### Events

External systems can listen for the following events:
- `KYCLevelAdded`: When new KYC levels are created
- `KYCLevelModified`: When existing levels are updated
- `KYCLevelRemoved`: When levels are deleted
- `KYCLevelAssigned`: When users are assigned KYC levels

This contract provides a flexible foundation for implementing KYC compliance in blockchain applications while maintaining upgradeability for future requirements.
