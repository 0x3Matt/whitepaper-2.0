• Leverage Decentralized Governance (DAO) to ensure collective
accountability and adaptability in compliance.
• Track and optimize engagement across B2B, B2G, and institutional
channels.

• Regulatory Impact Modeling: Models regulatory changes to assess their
effects on operations and finances, while developing contingency plans for
adverse outcomes.

under a fully regulated framework based in Mauritius, with ISO
certification for global standards, and integrates compliance
mechanisms directly into its infrastructure.
Robust Compliance Management: Employs clear policies, regular
training, audits, and dedicated compliance officers to ensure
adherence.
Institutional Legitimacy: Supported by Central Bank Digital
Currencies (CBDCs), reinforcing the validity of blockchain-based
assets.

• Proactive Regulatory Engagement: Participates in public consultations and
lobbies regulators to shape policies while fostering relationships for clarity on
expectations.
• Social Impact for Public Trust: Reinforces public trust by reinvesting 10% into
the Ubuntu Foundation for health and education and supporting sustainable
development goals (SDGs) through the Ubuntu Academy.

06 - Technology Solution

03 - Risk assessment

•

• Proactive Regulatory Assessment: Regularly evaluates
regulatory vulnerabilities, prioritizing risks based on likelihood
and potential impact.

Securing Trust at Every Layer
Security by Design
→ Our ecosystem is built with multilayered security as a foundational principle.
Trusted Cybersecurity Partner
→ We work with Panthera, a globally recognized firm, for audits, threat detection, and
penetration testing.
Global Standard Compliance
→ We meet ISO 27001 and 27701 standards, ensuring best-in-class data security and privacy.
Smart Contract Integrity
→ All smart contracts undergo peer review and continuous monitoring to prevent
vulnerabilities.
Investor Assurance
→ This robust setup creates a digital fortress around GIFT, reinforcing trust in every transaction.

End-to-End Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Resilience
We ensure cybersecurity through continuous system monitoring, automated
patching, and regular incident response drills. All smart contracts are designed,
audited, and tested end-to-end, with thorough code reviews before and after
deployment. Infrastructure reliability is maintained via 24/7 server monitoring,
automated updates, and real-time response. Non-Web3 platforms are
secured using Aikido for continuous scanning and alerts. On the gold side, we
partner with Sequoia for independent audits and enforce multi-signature
approvals to secure high-value transactions.

Systemic Risk in Traditional Gold Supply Chains
From forced labor to environmental degradation, the ethical, legal, and ESG risks embedded in artisanal
and large-scale gold sourcing threaten long-term trust, compliance, and sustainability.
Securing Identity and Value Transfer
All transactions are secured by blockchain immutability and cryptographic signatures. Identity verification is
enforced through KYC/AML protocols via regulated partners. Smart contracts eliminate manual processing errors,

while fraud alerts and anomaly detection tools (e.g., Aikido) provide real-time monitoring of suspicious activity.

Uninsured Losses Risk
Unlike funds in a traditional bank, digital tokens are not insured by government
programs. In the event of theft, malfunction, or platform collapse, users could face
complete asset loss with no recourse.

Our Solution

GIFT is 100% backed by insured, audited physical gold stored in top-tier vaults
across the world.
Independent auditors verify reserves using Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve
mechanism, and users can redeem tokens for gold at any time.

Our model does not rely on derivatives, which makes GIFT less vulnerable to
external fund manager decisions. This means that even in extreme market
scenarios, GIFT preserves real value and offers a safer alternative than many
supposedly “stable” coins.

Risk Mitigation: Customer Protection - Bankruptcy Risk
In case of bankruptcy, concerns may arise about whether users would retain access to their tokens or
the underlying gold reserves.

01 Legal Separation of Assets
Ubuntu Tribe operates as a state-chartered trust company,
meaning customer assets—including gold and GIFT tokens are

legally separated from the company’s corporate assets. In the
event of insolvency, these holdings are not part of the company’s
balance sheet and cannot be seized to cover company debts.

02 Bankruptcy-Proof Claim on Gold

04 Monetary Authority (BMA)

Regulatory Oversight by Bermuda

Ubuntu Tribe has secured in-principle approval from the BMA
and is finalizing its Virtual Asset and Payment Service Provider
licenses. These are among the most stringent regulatory

frameworks globally, reinforcing trust and legal protection for
users in case of operational failure.

GIFT =
Ownership and
Access at All
Times

Even if Ubuntu Tribe were to go bankrupt, token
holders would retain the right to claim the physical
gold backing their GIFT tokens. This setup ensures
that ownership rights remain intact regardless of the
company’s financial condition.

03 Breach of Contract
Unlike traditional banks, Ubuntu Tribe is not allowed to
use customer gold for speculative trading or
reinvestment. This ensures that the gold backing each
token remains untouched and fully available for
redemption at any time.
