INTRODUCING THE ERA OF "OPPORTUNITY ECONOMY"
We believe the future of money must be rooted in something real.

Physical gold brings trust, stability, and long-term
value in a world of volatile currencies and
speculative tokens. Ubuntu Tribe delivers inclusive,
gold-backed finance to the underserved, the
diaspora, and Web3-native users.
Active in 95+ countries with over 30,000 users,
$250M gold volume, our diverse community
includes women-led cooperatives in West Africa,
freelancers in Nairobi and Accra, and crypto-savvy
youth across Nigeria and Kenya.

I am because we are.
Ubuntu is our foundation, a belief in shared
value, community wealth, and inclusive
economic empowerment.

This global reach reflects our mission to meet
emerging financial needs with real, accessible value.

Dual-Brand Architecture
Phased Convergence by 2026 → Vaultoro and Utribe will merge into a single, unified financial experience, harmonizing tokenomics, user
experience, and asset infrastructure under the Ubuntu Tribe umbrella.

Vaultoro
Vaultoro is the institutional-grade backbone of the Ubuntu
Tribe ecosystem. It handles gold-backed token issuance
(GIFT), price stability, and regulatory compliance. It has
processed over $250M in trading volume and guarantees
100% gold reserves through audited vaults. Vaultoro builds
institutional confidence and underpins the ecosystem’s
integrity.

Utribe Wallet
Utribe is the mobile-first, MoMo-integrated app that brings
gold ownership to daily life. It enables users to save, send,
receive, and stake GIFT seamlessly, even with low-end
smartphones. Utribe is designed to be intuitive and trustbuilding, especially for first-time savers, unbanked
communities, and local cooperatives.

Bridging the Gap: How Ubuntu Tribe Outpaces Legacy Gold Tokens
Ubuntu Tribe stands apart in a crowded field by bridging tokenized gold with mobile-native access, delivering a solution designed not
for the few but for the Global Majority.

At the crossroads of digital wallets,
stablecoins, and tokenized gold,
but built for the Global Majority.
Differentiators:
• Mobile-first UX
• MoMo integration
• Gold access from just $0.05
• Backed by physical gold
Why It Matters: Others tokenize
gold. We deliver it locally,
accessibly, and intuitively.

Strategic Risk Management for GIFT: Navigating Regulatory, Trust,
Adoption, Technology, and Liquidity Challenges
01 - Regulatory Risk
Exposure: Evolving crypto laws, VASP licensing changes, or
cross-border payment restrictions could disrupt operations.

04 - Technology Risk

Mitigation: VASP license in EU (Czech Republic) and
Mauritius compliance. Legal partners monitor Africa and
diaspora jurisdictions. Modular infrastructure adapts to new
regulations.

Exposure: Downtime, smart contract flaws, or MoMo integration
failures could disrupt services.
Mitigation: Cloud-native, modular tech stack with multi-layered
security and third-party audits. Token issuance and wallet
infrastructure verified. Staged rollout ensures redundancy.

02 - Reputation & Trust Risk
Exposure: Asset backing loss, audit failure, or custodial issues
could damage user trust.
Mitigation: GIFT is 100% gold-backed with audited reserves and
on-chain proof. Vaultoro’s infrastructure has handled $250M+ in
gold transactions. NGOs, churches, and cooperatives bolster local
trust.

05 - Risk Liquidity & Price Risk
Exposure: Limited secondary market liquidity or gold market
volatility could affect GIFT utility.

03 - Adoption & Retention Risk

Mitigation: Planned listings on 6 Tier 1 exchanges for market
depth. Gold’s stability counters crypto volatility. Treasury tools and
staking support demand resilience.

Exposure: Low financial literacy, crypto skepticism, or onboarding
challenges may limit growth.
Mitigation: Intuitive UX (WhatsApp onboarding, mobile-first),
trusted partners (Africa’s Talking, Top Image Africa), and
embedded education drive adoption. Local incentives and
ambassador programs enhance retention.

Capturing a Multi-Billion Dollar Market in Digital Finance and Real Assets
Ubuntu Tribe targets remittances, mobile wallets, tokenized RWAs, and financial inclusion, serving massive underserved markets. Its blockchainbased suite (Vaultoro, GIFT, Utribe Wallet) delivers secure, gold-backed digital assets with regionally tailored distribution.

Remittance corridors (West Africa, East
Africa, North America) offer immediate GIFT
utility as a low-fee, inflation-resistant store
of value.

Crypto-savvy youth seek on-chain stable
assets that aren’t pegged to fiat volatility.

Unbanked and mobile-first users benefit
from Utribe Wallet’s MoMo off-ramps and
group savings features.

Institutional buyers and governments require
programmable, auditable, real-asset-backed digital
infrastructure, fulfilled through our TAAS offering.

to market hours.
