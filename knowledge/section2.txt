Why Gold? Why GIFT?
Gold’s status as a timeless store of value stems from its rarity, durability, and universal
acceptance across civilizations for millennia.
The Top performing Asset of the 21st Century
Over the last 20 years, gold has grown by
475%, and since 1971, consistently
outperforming many traditional assets.

Its long-term appreciation reflects gold’s
ability to store value across generations,
even through inflation and currency
devaluation.
Gold has played a foundational role in
the global monetary system, and
continues to be held as a strategic
reserve by central banks.

For nearly 15 years, central banks have
been net buyers, adding over 1,000
tonnes annually to strengthen financial
stability.
During major crises (2008 & financial
crash to the 2020 pandemic) gold
proved its status as a reliable hedge
and safe haven.

Historical Performance

The World Gold Council emphasizes gold’s
role as a long-term store of value, especially
during crises when it carries no credit risk,
making it a cornerstone of financial
stability.

GOLD VS FIAT - A CENTURY OF SHIFTING VALUE
As paper currencies depreciate and purchasing power erodes, gold remains the most reliable store of value across cycles, crises, and currencies.

Gold vs SP 500 Return

Since 2000, gold has consistently matched or outperformed the S&P 500
during major market downturns, proving its strength as more than just a
hedge. While equities depend on earnings forecasts and investor sentim ent,
gold responds to instability and monetary excess. As a counter-cyclical asset,
gold offers long-term upside and resilience. Unlike crypto, which remains
highly volatile, gold maintains stability through market turbulence, making it a
reliable store of value in uncertain tim es.

US – Dollar Index vs Gold Price

Many doubt crypto’s accessibility, yet The Atlantic Council’s CBDC Tracker
shows that 134 countries now explore CBDCs, up from just 35 in 2020.
Over half are already in advanced development, showing global momentum .
This shift proves digital currencies are no longer niche but a central pillar of
future finance. Ubuntu Tribe fits this evolution with a gold-backed, ethical
asset offering transparency and stability, as governments digitize money

GOLD VS OIL - A CENTURY OF SHIFTING VALUE
The Gold-to-Oil ratio is not just a historical curiosity, it’s a real-time indicator of monetary stress. When oil collapses, and gold holds, it
means trust is fleeing from fiat to real assets.

Ghana’s “Gold for Oil” Policy (2022–2024)

•

In 2022, facing dollar shortages and rising inflation, Ghana
began paying for imported oil using gold, not USD.

•

The program helped secure ~160,000 barrels/month of fuel
without draining USD reserves.

•

Gold is once again being used as a medium of exchange at
the sovereign level.

Gold Reinvented: Why GIFT Outpaces ETFs and Digital Gold Competitors
As traditional ETF products stall and tokenized gold remains limited in scope, GIFT unlocks a new era: programmable, mobile-first, yieldgenerating gold ownership, with unmatched accessibility and real-world impact.
Market-ready returns - Staking and DeFi integrations planned for 2025,
targeting stable 8–15% APY on gold holdings. A feature no ETF or gold
token currently delivers.
Real Economic impact - Every GIFT token supports conflict-free,
mercury-free artisanal mining. It also redistributes part of the revenue
directly to local communities.
Strong compliance - GIFT is backed by LBMA-certified gold, stored in
audited vaults by Brinks, Loomis, and Vaultoro. Each bar is traceable,
with real-time on-chain proof via Chainlink.

THE UBUNTU TRIBE ECONOMY

– STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL–

GIFT breaks the barrier - just €0.006 per token (1mg gold), GIFT is
the most accessible gold product on the market, opening access to
billions currently priced out of gold exposure.

Best-in-class Utility - Own, spend, save, and transfer gold
instantly through a mobile wallet. GIFT transforms gold from a
passive reserve into a daily financial instrument.

Utribe facilitates Gold transactions between mines & wholesale
buyers there by earning a facilitator transaction fee. The same gold
will then be transacted by Utribe as GIFT tokens on its platform and

The gold purchased from mines directly will yield a net discount of
5% to 8% indicating the third-party gold facilitation revenue.

Through Time Gold Remained More Than Enough
As investor flows soften, central banks quietly build gold positions, reinforcing gold's strategic role in global reserves.

Strong Inflation Hedge - Gold shows one of the highest correlations
with inflation (CPI corr. ≈ 0.6), unlike bonds or currencies.

Crisis Resilience - While equities and crypto collapse under systemic shocks,
gold often rises — becoming a safe-haven asset..

Low Counterparty Risk - Unlike equities, bonds or crypto, gold
carries no default, issuer, or leverage risk — it's a physical, bearer
asset.

High Accessibility - High Accessibility: Through ETFs, bullion, and now tokenized
platforms like GIFT, gold is more accessible than ever at all price points.

Moderate Volatility, Strong Return - Despite not being a "growth"
asset, gold has delivered a +72% return over 5 years with ~15% volatility
comparable to equities with less downside risk.

Low Correlation Advantage - Low Correlation Advantage: Gold helps diversify
portfolios, showing low correlation with most financial assets, especially during
downturns.

Gold is Quietly Leaving Wall Street and Powering Sovereign Strategy
As investor flows soften, central banks quietly build gold positions, reinforcing gold's strategic role in global reserves.

Smart vs. Emotional Capital
When volatility spikes, sovereigns quietly buy
gold, not for speculation, but for protection.

Strategic Allocation
Gold offers them what fiat cannot: monetary
independence, balance sheet stability, and
geopolitical insulation.

While short-term investors react to volatility, central banks quietly
build long-term positions in gold, not as a bet, but as a foundation.
Gold doesn’t follow the market. It anchors it.

De-Dollarization in Motion
This trend is accelerating across BRICS, Global
South, and emerging market banks.

Signal to Watch
Central bank gold accumulation has historically
preceded major monetary shifts, from rate
cycles to currency crises.

Tokenized strategic
minerals provide
access to real-world
assets tied to

undergoing
structural
transformation.

Materials such as
lithium, cobalt, nickel
and rare earths are
core components of
modern
technologies, from
electric vehicles to
renewable energy
systems and highperformance
electronics.

These assets exhibit
cyclical behavior, with
sharp rallies often
driven by demand
shocks or supply
constraints, followed
by periods of
correction or
stabilization as
production and
policy adjust.

Supply chains are
regionally
concentrated, often
within politically
sensitive zones. Their
strategic value is
increasingly reflected
in national security
agendas, trade policy
and foreign
investment flows.

Positioned at the heart
of decarbonization and

these minerals are seen
as ESG-enabling.
However, their

Forecasts indicate strong growth
potential across multiple natural
resources, with lithium, copper and
nickel expected to outperform
gold. Fueled by accelerating
demand from clean energy and
technology sectors, these minerals
are increasingly viewed as strategic
assets for long-term investment in
the context of the global green

While some, like rhodium, experienced explosive but erratic growth, others like
lithium and cobalt faced corrections after demand peaks. Gold stands out for its
steady, inflation-resistant performance, offering long-term price resilience with
lower volatility

Real-World Asset Tokenization Explanation
Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization involves converting physical or financial assets (real estate, art, bonds, etc.) into digital tokens on a blockchain.
This process democratizes investment access, enhances liquidity, and streamlines transactions while ensuring transparency and security

01

Tokens are created as single identifiers
on a distributed ledger and can
represent various assets, from financial
items to valuable resources.

02

Tokens are designed for divisibility,
ease of use, and facilitating trade. and
they are cryptographically secure
digital representations of value or
contractual

03

Tokens function as bearer
instruments, establishing a legal
relationship and assigning ownership

Premium-Free Access to a Trusted Asset

GIFT delivers the benefits stablecoins promise, without fiat exposure, regulatory drag, or entry cost.

Gold vs SP 500 Return

Stablecoin Premium = Proof of Demand

In emerging markets, businesses and individuals are already paying a
premium of up to 30.5% (Argentina) and 22% (Nigeria) just to access

GIFT: No Premium, No Peg Risk
Unlike USD stablecoins, GIFT doesn't require a premium to
access or hold value.
It's backed by gold , a real, inflation-resistant asset , and remains
free from the structural risks of fiat dependence.
In short, the market already exists. GIFT enters with stronger
fundamentals and fairer access.

Utribe facilitates Gold transactions between mines & wholesale
buyers there by earning a facilitator transaction fee. The same gold
will then be transacted by Utribe as GIFT tokens on its platform and
wallet developed.
The gold purchased from mines directly will yield a net discount of
5% to 8% indicating the third-party gold facilitation revenue.
